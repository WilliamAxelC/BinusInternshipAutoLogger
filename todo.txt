URGENT: FIX

✅ 1. CSV Validation Before Submission
    Warn users if any required fields are missing or if dates are invalid before processing.

    Show a popup (not just log output) if validation fails.

✅ 2. Preview Mode (Dry Run)
    Add a "Preview Entries" button that opens a new window or displays a summary (maybe in a Text or Treeview widget) of what will be submitted.

    Useful for catching errors before they’re sent to the server.

🔐 3. Encrypted Credential Storage
    If you’re storing credentials:

    Use cryptography.fernet to encrypt credentials locally.

    Add a "Forget credentials" button for users to clear saved logins.

📊 4. Submission Summary at the End
    At the end of a run, show:

    Total active days submitted

    Total OFF days auto-filled

    Total failures (if any)

    A summary box or log window with colored status per day

🖼️ 5. Improve GUI with Treeview for Log
    Use ttk.Treeview or a styled Text widget to color-code logs clearly:

    ✅ = green

    ❌ = red

    🟡 = yellow

📤 8. Export Logs to File
    Give users a way to export the session log to a .txt file.

🛠️ 10. "Test Login" Button
    A button that only tries logging in and retrieving cookies/headerID, to verify credentials without processing data.
